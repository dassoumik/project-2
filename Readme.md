## About this Project: 
One stop shop for users to find their playdates, locally. Users can set up or browse playdates while viewing who would be at each location.

Then other users are able to see my post and “click to follow” or “check in” 
Browse play dates
When I select browse
Then I am presented with a box to select miles away
