## About this Project: 
One stop shop for users to find their playdates, locally. Users can set up or browse playdates while viewing who would be at each location. 


## What we learned from this project: 
- Greyson- I learned how to use embed maps in an html as well as shortcuts for on clicks when handling basic stuff in the html.
- Soumik - How to update images, dates, and pull them from the database. 
- Aubrey - I learned about how the authentication process works.
- Tori - Learned how to better use handlebars and deploy to heroku.

When I enter in the date

Then other users are able to see my post and “click to follow” or “check in” 
Browse play dates
When I select browse

## Acceptance Criteria-- MVP
